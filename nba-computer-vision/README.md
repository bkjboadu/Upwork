To implement a project that involves detecting a basketball player shooting the ball from the 3-point line and obtaining the pose estimation of that specific player, you can follow these steps:

1. Player Detection:
Use a basketball player detection model to identify the player shooting the ball. This can be done using object detection models trained on basketball images or videos. You might consider using popular object detection frameworks like YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Faster R-CNN. Alternatively, you can use a pre-trained model from a library like TensorFlow Object Detection API.

2. Shot Detection:
Implement shot detection to identify when a player is shooting the ball. This could involve analyzing the motion patterns or using image processing techniques to recognize the shooting posture. You may need to experiment with various approaches and possibly combine them.

3. Pose Estimation:
Once you've identified the player shooting the ball, use pose estimation to obtain the player's joint positions. You can use the tf-pose-estimation library or other pose estimation models such as OpenPose. Make sure to focus on estimating the pose of the player detected in step 1.

4. Integration:
Integrate the results from steps 1, 2, and 3 to create a system that specifically detects and estimates the pose of a player shooting the ball from the 3-point line.
